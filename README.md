# Devin Widmer
Software Engineer

## About Me
  Hello, My name is Devin Widmer and I am pursuing my dream career as a software engineer. I am currently working as a software engineer intern at a local company in San Diego while I complete my final term for my degree program. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering from Southern New Hampshire University. Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU has really helped me to shape my professional goals and prepared me to become more employable in field. When I fisrt started my degree program I knew the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java programming languages, but not much else. The courses at SNHU have exposed me to Python, C++, C, binary, SQL, and Javascript. By learning about and gaining experience in different programming languages, I was able to better focus on what I liked and what I would like to pursue as a career after graduation. In addition to programming, I also gained experience in collaborating in a team environment and communicating to stakeholders.  In previous terms I completed courses that focused on source control and versioning practices in a team environment, secure coding practices, working in an agile development environment, and the Software Development Life Cycle.

  In order to demonstrate my knowledge of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases I created a brand new React app project from scratch. This project was created to serve as part of my final project for my computer science capstone course to demonstrate the knowlege I gained from the Computer Science program. The app I created is a fullstack application that I made using the MERN stack. The MERN stack utilizes MongoDB and Express on the backend and Node JS and React on the frontend. I created this app to serve as a sign up page for a coffee loyalty program I made up called Coffee Perks. To sign up, users enter their name, email, username and password using the user interface and the information is sent to and stored in the MongoDB database. Rather than submitting one artifact for each of the three categories of enhancement (software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases), I decided to start from scratch and build a custom app that would encompass all the requirements.
